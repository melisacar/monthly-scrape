# DHMI Monthly Data Pipeline
A data pipeline to **automate** the **scraping and transformation** of monthly airport traffic data from the DHMI (State Airports Authority) website. This project uses **Apache Airflow** to **schedule** the pipeline, fetches data with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, and stores transformed data in a PostgreSQL database.
